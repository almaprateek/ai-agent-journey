# Day 2: LLMs and Prompts

Today I learned what powers AI Agents — Large Language Models (LLMs). These are smart systems trained on books, websites, and more. They don't think like humans but guess the best word to say next. When I give them instructions (called prompts), they answer based on their training. Better prompts give better answers.

I also tried writing prompts in ChatGPT and saw how its tone and behavior change depending on my instructions.

Next up — I’ll learn how to build my first visual agent.
